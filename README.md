## Is it Wednesday, my dudes?

### Why?
Because I was tired of not being able to know what day it was at a moment's notice.

### How to use:
If you want him on your server, you can ask, but honestly he's hosted on my personal AWS instance which is currently not costing me anything so I don't really know if I want to have him on a bunch of Discord servers.
It wouldn't hurt to ask, though.

### DISCLAIMER TO CURRENT/PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS:
This repo is for the memes. Commit messages/filenames/etc are not indicative of how I do things in a professional environment.
But it is an indication of how I write code so yeah go ahead and look at that.
